% CGC Application Binary Interface

# NAME
CGCABI - CGC Application Binary Interface

# SYNOPSIS
\#include \<libcgc.h\>

# DESCRIPTION

This document details the Application Binary Interface (ABI) interface
used by to CGC Challenge binaries to access system calls and the initial
state of registers when a binary is loaded.

The ABI and system calls have been designed to create a minimal number of
system entry points that allows for the creation of CGC Challenge Binaries
that reflect real world services and allow authors to inject memory corruption
vulnerabilities consistent with the stated goals of the CGC program.

Challenge binaries are run in an Intel 32bit Architecture (IA32) protected
mode, flat memory model execution environment.

# System Calls

The following system calls are be present in a CGC binary execution
environment. With few exceptions, these system calls adhere to the POSIX
semantics associated with each corresponding system call as implemented on
the Linux operating system.  Each system call below is fully described in its
own manual page.

Name       |  Number
---------- | --------
_terminate |      1
transmit   |      2
receive    |      3
fdwait     |      4
allocate   |      5
deallocate |      6
random     |      7

A prototype for each system call is given in libcgc.h and a reference
implementation can be found in libcgc.a.

# System Call ABI

The CGC application binary interface is specific to compatible x86-32 bit
CGC execution environments.  In order to invoke a CGC system call, the
system call number must be placed in the eax register. Arguments to a
system call function are passed via registers ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi,
and ebp as summarized in the following table:

| Register  | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
|  eax      | Contains system call number |
|  ebx      | First argument to function |
|  ecx      | Second argument to function (if required) |
|  edx      | Third argument to function (if required) |
|  esi      | Fourth argument to function (if required) |
|  edi      | Fifth argument to function (if required) |
|  ebp      | Sixth argument to function (if required) |

Invocation of a system call function is accomplished through the use of
the 'int 0x80' instruction. All system calls that return, return a
status code in the eax register. A zero status indicates a successful
system call. A non-zero status indicates an error and the specific
error number is contained in the eax register. For system calls that
return a value, the return value is provided to the caller via a caller
supplied pointer parameter. See descriptions of individual system calls
for more detailed information on both status codes and required
parameters. If eax contains an invalid system call number upon entry to
the kernel, the status ENOSYS shall be returned.

# Invalid Instructions

The following instructions have undefined behavior if used in a CGC
Challenge Binary: rdpmc, rdrand, rdtsc, and rdtscp, and sysenter.

# Signals

Traditional POSIX signals are not supported by CGC Challenge Binaries.
A CB process receiving a signal is killed by the kernel and a core(5)
file may be produced. An exception to this rule is SIGPIPE. Normally,
SIGPIPE sent to a process kills the process. A SIGPIPE results in a
system call returning EPIPE.

# Constants / Defines

Several constants, structures, and macros are defined in libcgc.h
for use by CBs. The definitions of these symbols may not be the
same as the host operating system.

Symbol
* EBADF
* EFAULT
* EINVAL
* ENOMEM
* ENOSYS
* EPIPE
* FD_CLR
* FD_ISSET
* _fd_mask
* fd_set
* FD_SET
* FD_SETSIZE
* FD_ZERO
* _NFDBITS
* NULL
* SIZE_MAX
* size_t
* SSIZE_MAX
* ssize_t
* STDERR
* STDIN
* STDOUT
* timeval

# Initial State

The initial state of the various processor and coprocessor registers are
given below.

## Initial General Purpose Register State

Register |    Value
-------- | ----------
EAX      |          0
EBX      |          0
ECX      |          0
EDX      |          0
EDI      |          0
ESI      |          0
ESP      | 0xbaaaaffc
EBP      |          0
EIP      |    [note1]
EFLAGS   |      0x202
CS       |    [note2]
DS       |    [note2]
ES       |         DS
FS       |         DS
GS       |         DS
SS       |         DS

note1: The EIP is set to the value of "c_entry" specified in the header
of the CGC binary being loaded.

note2: The values of the segment registers are not specified; however,
the CS, DS, and SS registers will be set to correctly execute
the CB and DS = ES = FS = GS = SS.

The value of the EFLAGS register means that interrupts are enabled
(bit 9 set).  Bit 1 is always set.

## Initial Floating Point Unit Register State

Register        |     Value
-------------------| ------
Control            | 0x037f
Status             |      0
Tag                | 0xffff
Opcode             |      0
Instruction Pointer|      0
Data Pointer       |      0
R0, R1, R2, R3     |      0
R4, R5, R6, R7     |      0

The Control register value is decoded as follows:
rounding control = 0 (round closes to infinitely precise result,
if equal, round to even least significant bit)
precision control = 3 (double extended precision)
all exceptions = 0 (masked)

The tag register encoding just states that all fpu stack positions are
empty (b'11 for all eight registers).

## Initial MMX register state

The initial MMX register state is the same as the state of FPU since
the registers are aliased to the same storage.

## Initial XMM Register State (SSE)

Register       |  Value
---------------| ------
MXCSR          | 0x1f80
XMM0 ... XMM15 |      0

The MXCSR is decoded as follows:
flush to zero: disabled
rounding control = 0 (same as FPU, above)
all exceptions masked
no exceptions currently flagged

# Memory Layout

When a CB is loaded, the PT_LOAD sections of the binary describe the
layout of the binary in the 32bit virtual address space.  The permissions
of pages loaded by the binary are as specified (all pages are readable,
but may also be executable and/or writeable).

An initial stack is allocated for the process beginning from 0xbaaaaffc
and going down.  Stack pages are automatically allocated by the kernel
on behalf of the process.  All stack pages are readable, writable, and
executable.  Processes are allowed a maximum stack size of 8MB.

The data segment (program text section, readonly section, bss, and
read/write section), is limited to 1GB. This does not include memory
allocated by the allocate(2) system call.

There is no equivalent of argc, argv, envp normally provided by the
kernel to a process. The stack region is filled with zero's as it
is allocated and when execution begins at %eip, (%esp) = 0.

# Math Functions

The CGC library contains definitions for a variety of math functions
for which acceleration is available on the processor but would require
assembly language to access.  Those functions are as follows.

	 /* sine(x), where x is in radians */
	 float sinf(float);

	 float powf(float, float);
	 double pow(double, double);
	 long double powl(long double, long double);

# Other Functions

In addition to the system calls and math functions, two additional
functions are provided by the CGC ABI: setjmp() and longjmp(). These
functions allow for saving processor state and restoring it at some
point in the future.  Their behavior is meant to mimic the behavior
of these functions available in other operating systems.

# CAVEATS

The pow() functions are not conformant with C99.  For instance,
they return NaN for infinite exponents and for finite negative
bases with finite integer exponents.
